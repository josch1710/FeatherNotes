# FeatherNotes for OS/2 (by josch1710)

## Clipboard
Before version 5.15.2-1, the OS/2 port of Qt5 didn't support the system clipboard
(cf https://github.com/bitwiseworks/qtbase-os2/issues/123).
If you have an older version of Qt5, please update to the newest version.
Otherwise, FeatherNotes can't support the system clipboard. The application clipboard will work, though.

## Command line
* Because of limitation of Presentation Manager application, you will not see
any output on the command line. If you want to see the help or version strings
on the command line, you have to redirect the output, e.g. `feathernotes -h | tee -`.

## Miscellanea
* This port was made by Jochen Sch√§fer (os2@joschs-robotics.de). You find OS/2 binaries
 on my Github repository (https://github.com/josch1710/FeatherNotes/releases).
